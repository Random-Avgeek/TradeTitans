There are 2 codes in our project.

The first one is app.py, which has the backend of our website.

The backend is supported by 'flask' which is a production WSGI server based on Python.

The second one is frontend.py, which withholds in itself the frontend outlook of our website, ensuring it works robustly.

The front end is supported by Streamlit, a trusted source by 80% of the Fortune 50, used to host the site.

Our vision is to help newcomers in day trading by reporting to them about the market ups and downs in a simpler way.

These newcomers are mainly students pursuing their Bachelor's degree or master's degree in some or other field who are busy and rarely find time to study the market.

We are using simple linear regression (via the Scikit learn module) and displaying the market's future growth potential, where the Panda module comes with superior data analysis.

Concluding, we have used multiple modules to make our program work most accurately and robustly. We have the sincerest commitment towards the newcomers in day trading and hope they find it useful.
