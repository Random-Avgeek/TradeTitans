There are 2 codes in our project.
The first one is app.py, which has the backend of our website.
The backend is supported by 'flask' which is a production WSGI server based on python.
The frontend is supported by Streamlit, a trusted source by 80% of the fortune 50, used to host the site.
Our vision is to help the newcomers in daytrading by reporting them about the market ups and downs in a simpler way.
These newcomers are mainly students pursuing their Bachelors degree or Masters degree in some or the other field who are busy and rarely find time to study the market.
We are using simple linear regression (via scikit learn module) and displaying the market's future growth potential, where Panda module comes in with its superior predictive analysis.
