Currently, we have just made 1 website for the day trading analysis and aid.

However, we wouldn't stop here, at just 10 aspects of the NIFTY market. We prefer to make the world a better place (in terms of investment).

For that, we plan to expand our servers into the international markets where there is a higher scope for growth (for now at least).

Some include the US market, Eurozone and EU market or the Japanese Stock Market, which are considered the most secure and efficient markets.

That said, since India is the fastest-growing market, we will also expand our roots into the Indian market to provide a far more detailed analysis than what we offer now.

Lastly, we also plan on developing an app that can take direct queries from the users and report back to them based on the current trends of the stock market.
